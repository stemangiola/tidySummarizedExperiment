<meta property="og:title" content="distinct — bind_rows" />
<meta property="og:description" content="filter() retains the rows where the conditions you provide a TRUE. Note
that, unlike base subsetting with [, rows where the condition evaluates
to NA are dropped.
Most data operations are done on groups defined by variables.
group_by() takes an existing tbl and converts it into a grouped tbl
where operations are performed &quot;by group&quot;. ungroup() removes grouping.
summarise() creates a new data frame. It will have one (or more) rows for
each combination of grouping variables; if there are no grouping variables,
the output will have a single row summarising all observations in the input.
It will contain one column for each grouping variable and one column
for each of the summary statistics that you have specified.
summarise() and summarize() are synonyms.
mutate() adds new variables and preserves existing ones;
transmute() adds new variables and drops existing ones.
New variables overwrite existing variables of the same name.
Variables can be removed by setting their value to NULL.
Rename individual variables using new_name=old_name syntax.
See this repository
for alternative ways to perform row-wise operations.
slice() lets you index rows by their (integer) locations. It allows you
to select, remove, and duplicate rows. It is accompanied by a number of
helpers for common use cases:
slice_head() and slice_tail() select the first or last rows.
slice_sample() randomly selects rows.
slice_min() and slice_max() select rows with highest or lowest values
of a variable.


If .data is a grouped_df, the operation will be performed on each group,
so that (e.g.) slice_head(df, n=5) will select the first five rows in
each group.
Select (and optionally rename) variables in a data frame, using a concise
mini-language that makes it easy to refer to variables based on their name
(e.g. a:f selects all columns from a on the left to f on the
right). You can also use predicate functions like is.numeric to select
variables based on their properties.


sample_n() and sample_frac() have been superseded in favour of
slice_sample(). While they will not be deprecated in the near future,
retirement means that we will only perform critical bug fixes, so we recommend
moving to the newer alternative.
These functions were superseded because we realised it was more convenient to
have two mutually exclusive arguments to one function, rather than two
separate functions. This also made it to clean up a few other smaller
design issues with sample_n()/sample_frac:
The connection to slice() was not obvious.
The name of the first argument, tbl, is inconsistent with other
single table verbs which use .data.
The size argument uses tidy evaluation, which is surprising and
undocumented.
It was easier to remove the deprecated .env argument.
... was in a suboptimal position.


pull() is similar to $. It's mostly useful because it looks a little
nicer in pipes, it also works with remote data frames, and it can optionally
name the output." />

    <p>dplyr is not yet smart enough to optimise filtering optimisation
on grouped datasets that don't need grouped calculations. For this reason,
filtering is often considerably faster on <code>ungroup()</code>ed data.</p>
<p><code>rowwise()</code> is used for the results of <code>do()</code> when you
create list-variables. It is also useful to support arbitrary
complex operations that need to be applied to each row.</p>
<p>Currently, rowwise grouping only works with data frames. Its
main impact is to allow you to work with list-variables in
<code>summarise()</code> and <code>mutate()</code> without having to
use <code>[[1]]</code>. This makes <code>summarise()</code> on a rowwise tbl
effectively equivalent to <code>plyr::ldply()</code>.</p>
<p>Slice does not work with relational databases because they have no
intrinsic notion of row order. If you want to perform the equivalent
operation, use <code>filter()</code> and <code>row_number()</code>.</p>

<p>Because filtering expressions are computed within groups, they may
yield different results on grouped tibbles. This will be the case
as soon as an aggregating, lagging, or ranking function is
involved. Compare this ungrouped filtering:</p>
<p>The former keeps rows with <code>mass</code> greater than the global average
whereas the latter keeps rows with <code>mass</code> greater than the gender</p>

    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="backend-variations"><a class="anchor" href="#backend-variations"></a>Backend variations</h2>

    


<p>The data frame backend supports creating a variable and using it in the
same summary. This means that previously created summary variables can be
further transformed or combined within the summary, as in <code>mutate()</code>.
However, it also means that summary variables with the same names as previous
variables overwrite them, making those variables unavailable to later summary
variables.</p>
<p>This behaviour may not be supported in other backends. To avoid unexpected
results, consider using new names for your summary variables, especially when
creating multiple summaries.</p>
