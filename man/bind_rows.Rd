\title{Efficiently bind multiple data frames by row and column}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Data frames to combine.

Each argument can either be a data frame, a list that could be a data
frame, or a list of data frames.

When row-binding, columns are matched by name, and any missing
columns will be filled with NA.

When column-binding, rows are matched by position, so all data
frames must have the same number of rows. To match by value, not
position, see mutate-joins.}

\item{.id}{Data frame identifier.

When \code{.id} is supplied, a new column of identifiers is
created to link each row to its original data frame. The labels
are taken from the named arguments to \code{bind_rows()}. When a
list of data frames is supplied, the labels are taken from the
names of the list. If no names are found a numeric sequence is
used instead.}

\item{add.cell.ids}{from Seurat 3.0 A character vector of length(x = c(x, y)). Appends the corresponding values to the start of each objects' cell names.}
}
\value{
\code{bind_rows()} and \code{bind_cols()} return the same type as
the first input, either a data frame, \code{tbl_df}, or \code{grouped_df}.
}
\description{
This is an efficient implementation of the common pattern of
\code{do.call(rbind, dfs)} or \code{do.call(cbind, dfs)} for binding many
data frames into one.
}
\details{
The output of \code{bind_rows()} will contain a column if that column
appears in any of the inputs.
}
\examples{

data(se)
bind_rows(    se, se  )

se_bind = se |> select(dex,  albut)
se |> bind_cols(se_bind)
